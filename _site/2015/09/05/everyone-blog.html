  <li>If you are in tech do you need a blog presence?</li>
  <li>Why you Blog: for you? to get hired? to help others?</li>
  <li>The why? not the how</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you are in tech do you need a blog presence</strong></p>

<p>You cannot go to any site it seems without being inundated with clickbait. Worst, best, first, primer, latest… they are all there. So does the world need to know if I had a hard time nesting routes in my first rails app? Or if I have the best way to learn routing in 3 steps? Or this one trick to routes you have to know? Probably not. I’m not really a writter anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Why one Blogs</strong>
This blog is not for you. This blog is for me to write down my thoughts. The best way to learn is to teach. But there is no one who wants to learn for someone who is just starting. So I’m teaching myself. In blog form.</p>

<p><strong>The why? not the how</strong>
It doesn’t matter. Yet at the same time it does. If it helps you articulate your thoughts and make connections between what you are learning and the meaning of what you are doing.</p>
