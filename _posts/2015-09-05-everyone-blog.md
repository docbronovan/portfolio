title: Why does everyone have a blog?
---
It seems these days there is an endless amount of ways to share information. Are they all necessary?

* If you are in tech do you need a blog presence
* Blog for you? Blog to get hired? Blog to help?
* Does it matter?

Time to start something new? Start a blog about it to bump up your presence. This is the cynical approach to blogging that I find myelf falling into. You cannot go to any site it seems without being inundated with clickbait. Worst, best, first, primer, latest, worst.. they are all there. So does the world need to know if I had a hard time nesting routes in my first rails app?

**This blog is not for you.** This blog is for me to write down my thoughts. The best way to learn is to teach. But there is no one who wants to learn for someone who is just starting. So I'm teaching myself. In blog form. 

**It doesn't matter.** Yet at the same time it does. If it helps you articulate your thoughts and make connections between what you are learning and the meaning of what you are doing.
