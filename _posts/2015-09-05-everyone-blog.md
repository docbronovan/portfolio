It seems these days there is an endless amount of ways to share information. It is important to consider why and how you put information out into the world.

* If you are in tech do you need a blog presence?
* Why you Blog: for you? to get hired? to help others?
* The why? not the how

**If you are in tech do you need a blog presence**

So does the world need to know if I had a hard time nesting routes in my first rails app? Or if I have the best way to learn routing in 3 steps? Or this one trick to routes you have to know? Probably not. I'm not really a writter anyway. But I need to write about it because it helps me work though the problem.

> **You cannot go to any site it seems without being inendataed with clickbait. Worst, best, first, primer, latest.. they are all there.**

**Why Blog?**
This blog is not for you. This blog is for me to write down my thoughts. The best way to learn is to teach. But there is no one who wants to learn for someone who is just starting. So I'm teaching myself. In blog form. 

**The why, not the how**
It doesn't matter how you structure your blog or what you write about (unless you actually are trying to increase your online presence). If it helps you articulate your thoughts and make connections between what you are learning and the meaning of what you are doing.
