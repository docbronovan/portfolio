## Explanation

This is the first rails app I built.

## Problem

There are conversations I want to have with friends that I don't want the world to see and comment on.

## Solution

A private message board service where people can sign up, view all public topics, and create/share private topics with friends.

## Results

The app has log-in/log-out capability. Private/public options. The user may create comments. They can also upload an avatar and vote up or down responses.

## Conclusion

This was my first rails app and it turned out just as I expected.
