## Explanation

Utility Application With Rake Automation

## Problem

Too often people use text files on their desktops as todo lists. Other times, todo list apps are just too complicated.

## Solution

A simple todo list app which automatically clears tasks after 7 days. Because really, are you gonna do finish that task you've been meaning to do for 8 dyas?

## Results

The result is a simple app which uses JS and rake to update todos page.

## Conclusion

This project was the first time I implemented rake automation.
