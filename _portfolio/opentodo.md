## Explanation

API for a to-do list application, so that users can authenticate and manage their information externally.

## Problem

I don't want to have to log in via a web browser to add/remove information.

## Solution

Implement an API.

## Results

Now updates can be sent from the command line.

## Conclusion

This is my first time creating my own API and it wasn't nearly as hard as I thought it would be!
