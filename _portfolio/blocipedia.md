## Explanation
Production quality SaaS app that allows users to create their own wikis.


## Problem
Wikipedia won't let me write an entry about myself.


## Solution
Create my own version of Wikipedia.


## Results
Now I can collaborate with friends about the history of our fantasy football league.


## Conclusion
This was the first project I integrated stripe in. So if you are looking for a Wiki-like tool hit me up!

Also, this was the first app I took some liberties with the layout and design.
