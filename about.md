Hi, you've reached my portfolio. A little bit about me. My name is Brock. I live in Brooklyn and just finished the Bloc bootcamp. The projects you see on my portfolio page are all from bloc. If you want to check out a project I conceived and implemented on my own check out <a href="http://www.loclshows.com">localshows.com</a>. Feel free to contact me via the link at the top left corner of the screen if you are interested in working together.
